# very-simple-python-ai
i made this becuase i was bored this is just very basic using torch and even supports cuda if avalable it will be auto picket

IMPORTANT: this ai that comes with the premade training date is only in german you can do your own training data by deleting everyting in "text_training_data.txt" and putting your own thing into it so the ai will for example only speak in brainrot tearms
IMPORTANT: this code from my own expecienre only works with python 3.11 ifyour current version of python works with it nice other wise switch to version 3.11 to ensure the code runs right !!!

if you want to delete your current ai then simply delete the .pt file and rerun the program.

# Very Simply Python Ai Discord bot

use python 3.11 for best experience youl need torch and someother stuff for this bot
the code automaticly recognises your gpu and vram and will use cuda if avalable if not itl use cpu.
the training data file delete everything inside it and fill it with your own or paste for german the german training data into the file.
also you can only text wich the bot per dms.
insert your bot token in main.py at line 20 and you should be good to go.
training is slow at the time but as more i will improve it for better training. also it saved the ai model and loads it.
if an user writes dm with the bot its save the user id as an txt and save all the chat data.
