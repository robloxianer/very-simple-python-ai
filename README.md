# very-simple-python-ai
i made this becuase i was bored this is just very basic using torch and even supports cuda if avalable it will be auto picket

IMPORTANT: this ai that comes with the premade training date is only in german you can do your own training data by deleting everyting in "text_training_data.txt" and putting your own thing into it so the ai will for example only speak in brainrot tearms
IMPORTANT: this code from my own expecienre only works with python 3.11 ifyour current version of python works with it nice other wise switch to version 3.11 to ensure the code runs right !!!

if you want to delete your current ai then simply delete the .pt file and rerun the program
